# AACL 2022 workshop

Corpus In A Box: Automated Tools, Tutorials, & Advising (CIABATTA) tool

*Adriana Picoral, Larissa Goulart, Aleks Novikov and Shelley Staples*

For the second part of this workshop we will be using this Jupyter Notebook in Google colab, which requires no previous installation of Python. In this part of the workshop, we will walk participants through the processes of organizing the metadata in the CIABATTA demonstration corpus, adding headers to our individual text files, and standardizing filenames. We will use this pre-designed demonstration corpus for this as we have pre-prepared metadata which will allow us to focus on illustrating the logic of the scripts. The workshop will conclude with a discussion on next steps on corpus building, and what tools to use for corpus analysis once your offline corpus is built.
